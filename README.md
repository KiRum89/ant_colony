# ant_colony
This is a simple ant colony simulator. 
The ants start from the nest (the green circle) and initially scout following random paths. During the scouting ant leaves a pheromone path (green dots)
When the food (the red circle) is found, the ant turns 180 deg. and follows the pheromone path back home. On its way back home, the ant leaves another pheromone type.
When an ant in the scout mode find this pheromone, the ant will follow it to the food.
